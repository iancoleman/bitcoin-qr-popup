# Retired

This project is very old and comes from a time when bitcoin was a very different beast.

I do not recommend using this project in your POS! I leave it here because it may have some interest to some people.

Bitcoin QR Popup

A simpler interface to the bitcoin client for POS systems running Windows.

Press F2 - a QR window appears, then automatically disappears when payment is received and acknowledged.
Press F3 - a short history of transactions displays, making it easy to verify if the most recent payments were actually received.
